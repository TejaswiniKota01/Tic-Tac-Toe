# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI. The game supports both single-player and multiplayer modes.

## Features

- Single-player mode: Play against the computer AI.
- Multiplayer mode: Play against another human player.
- Responsive UI with a clean interface.
- Restart option available to start a new game.
- Automatic detection of winning condition or a draw.

## Getting Started

To run the game, you need to have Python installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file using Python:

    ```bash
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

## Gameplay Instructions

- Click on the mode buttons (`SinglePlayer` or `Multiplayer`) to select the game mode.
- Click on any empty cell in the grid to place your symbol (X or O).
- In single-player mode, you play as 'X' against the computer AI, which plays as 'O'.
- In multiplayer mode, two players take turns to place their symbols.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
